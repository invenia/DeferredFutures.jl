A `DeferredFuture` is like a regular Julia `Future`, but is initialized when `put!` is called on it.
This means that the data in the `DeferredFuture` lives with the process the data was created on.
The process the `DeferredFuture` itself lives on never needs to fetch the data to its process.
This is useful when there is a lightweight controller process which handles scheduling work on and transferring data between multiple machines.

## Usage

Use a `DeferredFuture` as you would a `Future`.
```julia
julia> DeferredFuture()
DeferredFutures.DeferredFuture(Future(1,1,3,Nullable{Any}()))

julia> DeferredFuture(3)
DeferredFutures.DeferredFuture(Future(3,1,4,Nullable{Any}()))
```

You can also use a `DeferredChannel` as you would a `RemoteChannel`.
```julia
julia> DeferredChannel(()->Channel{Int}(10), 4)
DeferredFutures.DeferredChannel(Future(4,1,5,Nullable{Any}()),#3)

julia> DeferredChannel(4)
DeferredFutures.DeferredChannel(Future(4,1,6,Nullable{Any}()),DeferredFutures.#2)

julia> DeferredChannel(4, 128; content=Int)
DeferredFutures.DeferredChannel(Future(4,1,2,Nullable{Any}()),DeferredFutures.#2)
```
Note that `DeferredChannel()` will create a `RemoteChannel` with `RemoteChannel(()->Channel{Any}(1), myid())` by default.

Furthermore, `@defer` can be used when creating a `Future` or `RemoteChannel` to create their deferred counterparts.
```julia
julia> @defer Future()
DeferredFutures.DeferredFuture(Future(1,1,2,Nullable{Any}()))

julia> @defer RemoteChannel(()->Channel{Int}(10))
DeferredFutures.DeferredChannel(Future(1,1,1,Nullable{Any}()),#1)
```

Note that `DeferredFuture(n)` does not control where the data lives, only where the `Future` which refers to the data lives.
